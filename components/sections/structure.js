    <p>your project also comes with a few directories</p>
    <p>these names have special meanings for the build tool, so it's good to know what they do:</p>

      <li class="mb3">
        <strong>assets/</strong><br>
        static files that can be served up, such as images and fonts
      </li>

      <li class="mb3">
        <strong>components/</strong><br>
        reusable fragments that can be composed into views
      </li>

      <li class="mb3">
        <strong>views/</strong><br>
        combinations of components that are mapped to routes
      </li>

      <li class="mb3">
        <strong>stores/</strong><br>
        pieces of logic that are shared by multiple components
      </li>

      <li class="mb3">
        <strong>plugins/</strong><br>
        special stores capable of interacting with the app instance
      </li>
